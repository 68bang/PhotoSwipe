PhotoSwipe
==========

A mobile photos gallery/browser.

This is a direct adaptation from the example presented in the demos of jquery.touchSwipe: [TouchSwipe-Jquery-Plugin/demos/Image\_gallery\_example.html]{https://github.com/mattbryson/TouchSwipe-Jquery-Plugin/blob/master/demos/Image_gallery_example.html}

I modified the code to permit to have multiple galleries on the same page and to make it as easy as possible.

How to use it?
--------------

Include those files in your header:

    <link href="css/photos_gallery.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="javascript/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="javascript/jquery.touchSwipe.min.js"></script>
    <script src="javascript/galleryPhotos.js"></script>

To create a new gallery, just put all your images inside those div blocks:

    <div id="content">
      <div class="imgs">
        <img src="...">
      </div>
    </div>
